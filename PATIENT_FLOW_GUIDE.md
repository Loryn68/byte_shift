# Child Mental Haven - Patient Flow System

## How Patient Flow Works:

### Registration-Based Routing

**Laboratory Registration** → Patient goes directly to **Laboratory** department
- Patients registered specifically for lab services
- Direct routing to lab for sample collection and testing

**Pharmacy Registration** → Patient goes directly to **Pharmacy** department  
- Patients coming to collect prescribed medications
- Direct routing to pharmacy for medication dispensing

**All Other Services** → Patient goes to **Triage** department
- Consultations, reviews, psychiatric evaluations, etc.
- Initial assessment and prioritization in triage
- Then routed to appropriate clinical departments based on medical needs

### Workflow Process:
1. **Registration** - Patient details captured with service type
2. **Payment Processing** - Consultation/service fees collected
3. **Department Routing** - Automatic routing based on registration type:
   - Lab services → Laboratory
   - Medication collection → Pharmacy  
   - All consultations/clinical services → Triage
4. **Clinical Services** - Appropriate medical care delivered
5. **Discharge/Follow-up** - Patient completion and next steps

This ensures efficient patient flow with specialized direct routing for lab and pharmacy services, while all clinical consultations go through proper triage assessment.
